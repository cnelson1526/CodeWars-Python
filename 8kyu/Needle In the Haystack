Task

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

Example(Input --> Output)

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 
Note: In COBOL, it should return "found the needle at position 6"



Solution

def find_needle(haystack):
    for i in haystack:
        if i == 'needle':
            return 'found the needle at position {}'.format(haystack.index(i))
