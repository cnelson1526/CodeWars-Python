Task

In this example you have to validate if a user input string is alphanumeric. The given string is not nil/null/NULL/None, so you don't have to check that.

The string has the following conditions to be alphanumeric:

At least one character ("" is not valid)
Allowed characters are uppercase / lowercase latin letters and digits from 0 to 9
No whitespaces / underscore



Solution

def alphanumeric(password):
    return True if len(password) > 0 and " " not in password \
    and len([i for i in password if i.isdigit() or i.isalpha()]) == len(password) \
    else False
